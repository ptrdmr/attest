# Attest MVP — Canonical Work Order

Product plan: signed proof of shipped work for freelancers; public Capability
Record is the moat. This file is the charter-mandated plan of record: owning
departments, consults, role sequences, boundaries, and test strategy per
milestone. The orchestrator maintains it as work progresses.

Approved dependencies: Django (core). Stripe SDK / AI client / boto3 enter only
when real integrations are wired, each requiring explicit approval.

## Milestones

### M0 — Foundation (orchestrator, fast path) — DONE when committed
- git root in this folder, venv, Django 6 scaffold (`config`, `ledger`, `surface`)
- Env-driven settings (SQLite dev / `DATABASE_URL` Postgres), console email
- Tooling: uv + ruff (dev deps), .gitignore, README, this plan
- Boundaries: repo root config files, `config/`, empty app scaffolds
- Tests: `manage.py check` + empty suite green

### M1 — Ledger core (owning: Ledger; consults: none; hazard: signing/hash)
- Role sequence: Implementer (Sol — hazard zone) → Implementer-adversary
  (Sonnet) → Verifier (Composer) → Verifier-adversary (Grok) → Gate → commit
- Models: Profile, Project (status machine: draft → criteria_pending → active →
  delivered → attested / disputed), AcceptanceItem, ChangeOrder, Attestation
  (payload_hash, client_email, signed_at, signature_meta), CapabilityTag
- Services: status transitions, canonical-JSON + SHA-256 hashing, sign_attestation
  (append-only enforcement), capability-record derivation
- Boundaries: `ledger/**` only. Schema authorized: initial migration for the
  models above
- Tests: status-machine guards, hash round-trip, immutability enforcement,
  dispute freeze flag, derivation correctness

### M2 — Auth + project surface (owning: Surface; consult: Ledger read-only;
hazard: magic-link tokens)
- Role sequence: Implementer (Sol) → Implementer-adversary (Sonnet) →
  Verifier (Composer) → Verifier-adversary (Grok) → Gate → commit
- Magic-link login (email → signed token → session), client access tokens
  (signed, expiring, no account), base template + HTMX, project CRUD, criteria
  builder UI, client review/approve page
- Boundaries: `surface/**`, `templates/**`, `static/**`, `config/urls.py`
- Tests: token expiry/tamper, login flow, client approve flow, criteria editing
  locked after approval

### M3 — Delivery + attestation + public record (owning: Surface; consult:
Ledger read-only; hazard: signing flow, public record)
- Delivery checklist + evidence links, e-sign page (typed signature), public
  Capability Record at `/u/<handle>`, dispute freeze on public display
- Boundaries: `surface/**`, `templates/**`, `config/urls.py`; Ledger waiver
  ONLY if a service signature needs extension (flag to orchestrator first)
- Tests: sign flow end-to-end, hash surfaced on record, disputed attestations
  frozen/annotated, no PII/tokens in rendered output

### M4 — Change orders + billing gates
- **M4a (Ledger waiver, owning: Ledger; hazard: trust transitions):** add
  `propose_change_order`, `approve_change_order`, `decline_change_order`;
  unresolved PROPOSED change orders block `mark_delivered`. Schema: none
  (ChangeOrder model already exists). Role sequence: Sol → Sonnet → Composer
  → Grok → Gate → commit.
- **M4b (Surface, owning: Surface; consult: Ledger; hazard: billing tokens):**
  change-order UI + client token purpose `change_order`; billing gates behind
  stub provider (no Stripe SDK). Role sequence: Sol → Sonnet → Composer →
  Grok → Gate → commit.
- Tests: CO transitions + unresolved block; Surface out-of-scope flow; billing
  stub gate enforcement

### M5 — Landing + AI draft stub (owning: Surface)
- Landing page (hero: "Signed proof you shipped", one CTA, record visual),
  AI provider interface with deterministic stub: paste dump → draft brief +
  criteria → human-confirm before client exposure
- Tests: draft never client-visible pre-confirm; landing renders

## Standing rules
- Gate (fresh-context, Fable) runs on the final combined diff before EVERY commit
- Orchestrator owns git; specialists never commit
- Refit candidates and escalations logged here

## Log
- 2026-07-18: M0 executed. Django 6.0.7 (latest stable at install time; plan
  said 5.x — noted, no action needed)
- 2026-07-18: M1 executed. Builder (Sol) → adversary (Sonnet) rejected once
  (OneToOne blocked amendment chains; queryset-update bypass; admin delete
  hole) → fixed → accepted. Verifier (Composer, 47 tests) → adversary (Grok)
  rejected once (sort_keys and is_disputed filters not load-bearing) → fixed →
  accepted with mutation-testing proof. Gate: PASS
- Refit candidates: (1) make is_disputed/disputed_at admin-readonly and route
  admin dispute handling through services so tag recompute always runs;
  (2) drop redundant db_index=True on Attestation.project FK
- 2026-07-18: M2 executed. Implementer-adversary (Sonnet) rejected once (no
  tests; HTMX 400 validation paths invisible; DEBUG review_url token in HTML)
  → fixed. Verifier (Composer, 34 surface tests) → Verifier-adversary (Grok)
  rejected once (softball locked-mutation asserts) → fixed → accepted. Gate
  (Fable): PASS. Full suite 81 tests green.
- 2026-07-18: M3 executed. Builder (Sol) → Implementer-adversary (Sonnet)
  rejected once (missing Surface tests; HomeView drive-by; already-signed UX)
  → fixed. Verifier (Composer, +19 surface tests → 53) → Verifier-adversary
  (Grok) rejected once (softball purpose-isolation GET) → fixed → accepted.
  Gate (Fable): PASS.
